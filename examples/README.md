## caddy

This currently relies on [dotvezz/caddy-mirror](https://github.com/dotvezz/caddy-mirror), which requires a custom build of caddy, see [example](./caddy/).

## nginx

This is done using the built-in `mirror` function, see [example](./nginx/).

## traefik

This is done using a built-in `mirroring` service, see [example](./traefik/).
